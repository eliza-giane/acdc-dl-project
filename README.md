**This is the ACDC Superresolution Project for Deep Learning at AIT by Eliza Giane, Shirui Li, and Lydia Yang.**


This project was prompted by the challenge (found [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/index.html)). The data consists of real anonymized and regulated clinical exams from the University Hospital of Dijon, and is described as follows on the challenge's website:

---
"Our dataset covers several well-defined pathologies with enough cases to (1) properly train machine learning methods and (2) clearly assess the variations of the main physiological parameters obtained from cine-MRI (in particular diastolic volume and ejection fraction)." 

"The dataset is composed of 150 exams (all from different patients) divided into 5 evenly distributed subgroups (4 pathological plus 1 healthy subject groups) as described below. Furthermore, each patient comes with the following additional information : weight, height, as well as the diastolic and systolic phase instants."

 The dataset is found [here](https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb/folder/637218e573e9f0047faa00fc) and the provided code for handling .nii files is found [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/code/metrics_acdc.py).
